## CTF Challenge Write-Up: "What's Your Name?"

### Challenge Overview
In this challenge, participants are tasked with exploiting a binary executable to retrieve a hidden flag. The binary prompts the user for their name and processes the input in a specific manner. By analyzing the provided decompiled code and leveraging fuzzing results, participants can craft a payload to extract the flag.

### Initial Interaction Analysis
The initial interaction analysis reveals the following behavior of the binary:
- The binary consistently outputs "What's your name ?" regardless of the input provided.
- The input is not reflected in the output, indicating that the input is processed internally without direct echoing.

### Decompiled Code Analysis
The decompiled code provides insight into how the binary processes the input:
1. **Function: `FUN_00401642`**
   - This function is the main entry point for the interaction.
   - It calls `FUN_00401740` to perform some initialization.
   - It then prompts the user with "What's your name ?" and reads up to 40 bytes of input into a local buffer `local_38`.
   - The input is then passed to `FUN_004015cb` for further processing.

2. **Function: `FUN_004015cb`**
   - This function processes the input character by character.
   - It copies each character from the input to a local stack buffer `acStack_38`.
   - If the character 'z' is encountered, it appends a specific value (-0x77) to the buffer.
   - The function ensures that no more than 40 characters are processed.

3. **Function: `FUN_00401740`**
   - This function performs a simple check and initialization.

### Payload Construction
Based on the decompiled code, the following observations can be made:
- The buffer `acStack_38` can hold up to 40 characters.
- The function `FUN_004015cb` appends an additional value when 'z' is encountered, potentially altering the buffer's content.

### Fuzzing Results
The fuzzing results provided a successful payload that reveals the flag:
- **Payload:** `\nzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz`
- **Flag:** `flag{7efzf7dfdfhtr7jtkyuhg22d4fh}`

### Exploitation Steps
1. **Run the Binary:**
   - Execute the binary to observe the initial prompt.
   - The binary will ask, "What's your name ?".

2. **Input the Payload:**
   - Provide the payload `\nzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz` as input.
   - This payload leverages the processing logic in `FUN_004015cb` to manipulate the buffer and trigger the flag retrieval.

3. **Retrieve the Flag:**
   - The binary processes the input and reveals the flag: `flag{7efzf7dfdfhtr7jtkyuhg22d4fh}`.

### Conclusion
By analyzing the decompiled code and utilizing fuzzing results, participants can craft a specific payload to exploit the binary and retrieve the hidden flag. This challenge demonstrates the importance of understanding buffer handling and input processing in binary exploitation.

### Key Takeaways
- **Buffer Overflow:** Understanding how buffers are managed and manipulated is crucial in binary exploitation.
- **Fuzzing:** Automated fuzzing can help identify potential vulnerabilities and craft effective payloads.
- **Reverse Engineering:** Analyzing decompiled code provides valuable insights into the binary's behavior and potential weaknesses.

Good luck, and happy hacking!
